<h1>Clipjump Custom</h1>
<i>[v10.6+]</i><br><br>

<b>ClipjumpCustom.ini</b> can be configured to change hidden variables in Clipjump to make Clipjump totally custom for a user.<br>
The file is created and loaded when you start Clipjump.<br>
It gives power to-
<ul>
	<li>Change previously unchangeable shortcuts
	<li>bind a hotkey to an action (like a hotkey to toggle Incognito Mode)
	<li>run coded <i>labels</i> and <i>functions</i> to tailor-make any complex user function.
	<li>run a plugin at will or at required condition
	<li>send key-presses to facilitate scripting / macro
</ul><br>

<h2>Basic commands</h2>
The Ini can contain multiple sections ([....]) which may use the following commands in needed order to execute them one by one.
<ul>
	<li><a href=#ex1>run</a> - run a label or function
	<li><a href=#ex1>bind</a> - bind a hotkey (shortcut) to a section
	<li><a href=#ex1>tip</a> - show a tooltip with text
	<li><a href=#send_ex>send</a> - sends or stimulates text
	<li>sleep - wait for time in milliseconds
	<li><a href=#noautorun_ex>noautorun=1</a> - use it to prevent autoRun of a section at clipjump startup
</ul>
Besides this you can also change the inner variables of Clipjump just by using a variable = value syntax.<br>
Some of the most common variables needed to work highly requested features have been given below.<br>
Go through them as a tutorial as they contain important information about the correct syntax and usage.<br>
<font class=red>Note</font> - Restart Clipjump after making changes in ClipjumpCustom.ini to take them into effect.<br><br><br>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3><a name=ex1>Example 1 (Shortcut to toggle Incognito Mode)</a></h3>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[toggle_incognito]
bind=Win+Alt+I
run=incognito
tip=Incognito Mode toggled
</pre>
The above code uses 3 commands, bind, run and tip.<br>
<ol>
	<li><code>Bind</code> creates a shortcut for the section meaning that the section will not <b>auto-execute at Clipjump start.</b>
	Here that shortcut is <code>Win + Alt + I</code>.
	<li><code>run</code> runs the label 'incognito' inside Clipjump which is responsible for toggling incognito mode.
	<li><code>tip</code> shows a tooltip when this custom function is run. Here the tip shown will contain the text 'Incognito Mode toggled'.
</ol>
Note that you can also use <code>noautorun=1</code> to prevent auto-execution of section even if it doesn't have a 'bind'.<BR> 
<a name=not_autorun></a><b>TIP - </b> Only a section which has neither a <code>bind</code> nor a <code><a href=#noautorun_ex>noautorun = 1</a></code> runs at Clipjump program startup.
<br><br><br>


<h3><a name=change_mode_key><a name=2>Example 2 (changing paste-format key to Y)</a></a></h3>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[AutoRun]
pastemodekey.z=^y
</pre>
The above code changes the inbuilt variable <code>pastemodekey.z</code> to '^y' i.e. y . <br>
If you remember, z is the default easy key for toggling Paste formats in Paste Mode. The above code runs at Clipjump start (as the section has no 'bind') and changes the 
PasteMode inbuilt variable.<br>
<ul>
	<li>The Pastemode group has all variables as pastemodekey.(key) where '(key)' is the original key. Same is for SearchMode. It has all variables as 		spmkey.(key). So the following code will also change 'Channel up', 'Channel down' and 'paste-format' shortcut in PasteMode <b>and</b> 'cancel' shortcut in SearchMode.
		<pre class="brush: ini;">
[AutoRun]
pastemodekey.z=^y
pastemodekey.up=^q
pastemodekey.down=^d
spmkey.home=PgDn</pre>
	<li>The key names are according to the <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm">AutoHotkey key list</a>. 
</ul>
<br><br>


<h3>Example 3 (Shortcut to check for updates)</h3>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[section_name_can_be_anything]
run=updt
bind=Win+Alt+U
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>'updt' is label used in Clipjump to update and the 'run' command runs it.
	<li>As you see, it is not necessary to keep 'bind' at the first line of the section. It can be anywhere.
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3>Example 4 (Shortcut to paste current content on system clipboard instantly [without formatting])</h3>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[paste_current]
bind=Ctrl+Shift+V
run=simplePaste

[paste_without_formatting]
bind=Win+V
run=API.runPlugin(noformatting_paste.ahk)
</pre>
The above code has 2 examples, [paste_current] is to paste current clipboard as it is and [paste_without_formatting] is to paste current clipboard
without formatting.
<ul>
	<li>'simplePaste' is label in Clipjump to paste current content on Clipboard.
	<li>API.runPlugin( plugin_path ) runs a plugin file. Here in the 2nd section, it runs the plugin file noformatting_paste.ahk which is supposed to contain the code 
		to paste without formatting. Learn more about <a href="plugins/index.html#run">API.runPlugin()</a>.
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3>Example 5 (Instantly switching to your fav channel)</h3>
Suppose you fav channel is #4 as it stores some important web links. We will use the inbuilt changeChannel function in Clipjump to do the purpose.
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[changeto_4]
bind=Win+4
run=changeChannel(4)
tip=Channel changed to 4
</pre>
<br><br>

<h3><a name=actmd>Example 6 (Running a section with Action Mode)</a></h3>
Suppose you don't want to create a separate shortcut Win+V for the above example. Here is how to create a Action Mode shortcut for it.
<a name=noautorun_ex></a>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[changeto_4]
noautorun=1
<span style="color: green;">; noautorun prevents auto-execution of a section in absence of bind</span>
run=changeChannel(4)
tip=Channel changed to 4

[actionmode_f10]
<span style="color: green;">; here I don't use noautorun as I want it to run at startup and make the change</span>
ACTIONMODE.F10 = API.executeSection(changeto_4)
ACTIONMODE.F10_caption = Change 2 my channel
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><code class=syntax>API.executeSection( section_name )</code> can be used to execute any section any time. section_name is the name of the section to be executed.
	<li>Actionmode keys are customizable with the <code>ACTIONMODE.(key)</code> variable. The <code>ACTIONMODE.(key)_caption</code> variable holds the caption for the 
		action shown in Action Mode.
	<li>The <code>ACTIONMODE.(key)</code> on the other hand holds the label/function/routine to be executed when the key is pressed. Here we are executing the function 
		<code class=syntax>API.executeSection()</code> with the first parameter as <code>changeto_4</code>
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3>Example 7 (Paste Signature)</h3>
So you have your signature "FIXED" in the Clip 1 position of 2nd channel as you use it always. <br>
Here is an awesome customization for you-
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[paste_sig]
bind=Ctrl+F8
run=API.paste(2,1)
</pre>
API.Paste(channel_number, clip_number) is a function that paste clip_number from channel_number in Clipjump. Pressing Ctrl+F8 will automatically paste your signature now.
<br><br><br>

<h3><a name=inputbox>Example 7.5 (Getting the clip to paste)</a></h3>
You can use the inbuilt <code>inputbox</code> function to retrieve the 'clipno' to paste. This procedure can also be done for the 'channelno'.
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[paste_sig]
bind = Ctrl+F8
zClipno = 1
<span style="color: green;">; zClipno = %inputbox(Choose, Please write the clip number to be pasted)%</span>
run = API.paste( 2, %zClipno% )
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>In the line <code>zClipno = 1</code>, zClipno is a user created variable that is assigned the value of 1.
	<li>The variable is fed into API.paste() function by wrapping it with %....% . So you can say that %...% is used to declare that something is a variable i.e. NOT 
		Literal TEXT.
	<li>In the commented line containing <code>...%inputbox...%</code> the variable zClipno is assigned the return value of inputbox() function. As the whole function call 
		is NOT supposed to be A FIXED TEXT, we have used %...% over it. You can try un-commenting that line and then restarting Clipjump to see what happens.
	<li><code class=syntax>inputbox( title , caption_text )</code> is basically a function that shows a dialog box for the user to enter text. Once text is entered and OK is pressed, 
		the function returns the text entered by user to the variable calling it.
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3><a name=send_ex>Example 8 [SEND] (Filling Form)</a></h3>
The first example using Send. As briefed above, the command sends or stimulates a key press.<br>
So to get started, know that 'Send' has some rules which must be noted.<br>
<ul>
	<li>To simulate key combination press like Win+C, use <code class=syntax>send=Win+C</code>. When pressing key combination using send, keep it in a single line.
	<li>To simulate a key press like Tab or PageDown, use <code class=syntax>send={Tab}</code> or <code class=syntax>send={Enter}</code> or <code class=syntax>send={tab}{enter}</code> if you want both.
	<li>To write text using send command like 'Hi there', use <code class=syntax>send=Hi there</code>.
</ul>
<br>
<b>Situation</b> - Suppose you want to fill a web form with 4 fields and the fields focus can be switched with TAB, here is the customization to use -
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[fill_that_form]
bind=Ctrl+Shift+F9
run=API.paste(,1)
send={tab}
run=API.paste(,2)
send={tab}
run=API.paste(,3)
send={tab}
run=API.paste(,4)
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Keep focus on the first of the 4 fields and press Ctrl+Shift+F9 and watch all the other 4 fields filled automatically.
	<li>As you may have read in example 7, API.paste() pastes clipno from channelno. If channelno is blank (like here), it defaults to the current active channel.
	<li>You may use <code class=syntax>sleep=500</code> to wait for a particular time in milliseconds.
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3>Example 9 (moving clips)</h3>
We will use the <code class=syntax>API.manageClip(new_channel, channel, clip, flag)</code> function here. 'channel' and 'clip' default to the current active ones if no value for them 
is passed. <br>
<b>Situation</b> - Suppose you copied a trash / incorrect information in the current protected / normal channel accidental. Here is the code to move it to 
<a href="channels.html#Pit">Pit</a> channel which is say at Chno. 2<br>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[trash_clip]
bind=Ctrl+Win+Del
run=API.manageClip(2,,,0)
tip=The current active clip was gvdlfe off!
</pre>
The last parameter 'flag' is 0 for move and 1 for copy. Here we are moving the clip.
<br><br>
<br>

<h3><a name=autoPastemode>Example 10 (paste mode with search enabled; no need to hold Ctrl)</a></h3>
If you don't like holding down Ctrl to navigate clips, this if for you. This Customization will bind 'Win+V' to open paste mode with Search enabled so 
you will be able to use Up/Down keys to navigate through the clips.
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[paste_with_search]
bind=Win+V
spm.active=1
run=paste
run=searchpm
</pre>
<br><br>

<h3>Example 11 (emptying a channel)</h3>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[empty_pit]
bind=Win+Alt+E
run=API.emptyChannel(pit)
tip=Pit Channel is now empty
</pre>
The above uses the <code class=syntax>API.emptyChannel(channel_no)</code> function. If <code>channel_no</code> is empty ( like API.emptyChannel() ), the current 
active channel is taken into account. 
If <code>channel_no</code> is not number, a channel with name as <code>channel_no</code> is taken into account. If <code>channel_no</code> is 
number, it is supposed that <code>channel_no</code> contains a channel number to be used.
<br><br>
<br>

<h3><a name=vars><a name=store>Example 12 (Variables concept and STORE.)</a></a></h3>
<pre class="brush: ini;">
[SEC1]
STORE.myVar = text in store.myvar
anotherVar = text in anotherVar
tip = %STORE.myVar%
sleep = 1000
tip = %anotherVar%
sleep = 1000

[SEC2]
tip = Sec2 is now started
sleep = 1000
run = API.showTip(%STORE.myVar%)
sleep = 1000
run = API.showTip(%anotherVar%, 1000)
</pre>
<ul>
	<li>STORE.varname can be used by users to create variables that are saved all through Clipjump runtime and can be accessed anywhere. In the above code, both SEC1 AND 
		SEC2 neither have bind nor 'noautorun=1' so they will run at Clipjump startup.
	<li>SEC1 will run before SEC2 and will add values to the variables 'STORE.myVar' and 'anotherVar'.
	<LI>A <code>tip</code> confirms what the value is stored in these variables. Note that tip default shows for 1000 milliseconds (1 second) and so we use <code  class=syntax>sleep=1000</code> to pause execution for that time so that tip is properly shown. You can also use the function 
		<code class=syntax>API.showTip(text, time_in_ms)</code> as I have used in 'SEC2'.
	<li>When the above customization runs, you will see that <code>tip</code> containing %anotherVar% is not shown in SEC2. It is because %anotherVar% is unaffective there. It's lifetime was only till SEC1 where it was created.
	<li>%STORE.myVar% on the other hand will be active at all times and you will see its tip in SEC2.
</ul>
