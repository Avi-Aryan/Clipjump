	<h2><a name=about>About</a></h2>
	Clipjump Channels is a new feature innovated in <strong class=super> Clipjump in v7.7b1 </strong> and is likely to be continued in future releases.<br />
	It is meant to allow users to use multiple channels of multiple Clipboards for sorting related Clipboard items together.<br />
	The feature is accessible from the default shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+C) as well as the Tray Menu.<br /><br />
	Channels are different series in which clips are stored. If you have used some older version of Clipjump, you will be aware that <b>Clipjump</b> captured Clipboard 
	data on the Clipboard one after another giving no room for keeping certain data together. There was no way in which you would store some 15 addresses commonly used at 
	Office work or 30 cool links while surfing at a reserve place so that they are there for eternity and easily found when needed. The version 7.7 just solves this 
	problem.<br><br>
	Now you can choose from unlimited channels to store Clipboard data and then activate the channel and find your data when needed. The Channel index starts from 0 and 		goes till infinity.
	<br />Just reserve a channel Index for a group and get going . <br />
	<br /><br />

	<h2><a name=using>How to Use</a></h2>
	As said above, use the default shortcut or the Tray Menu for Clipjump to open the choose Channel Window.<br />
	<a href="../images/channelGUI.jpg"><img src="../images/channelGUI.jpg"></a><br>
	The Window should appear instantly and you will see the Channel Number 0 to be active by default.<br />
	Use the Up-Down and select a different channel. As 0 is the only channel used in a new installation of Clipjump, you will be only allowed to select the next Channel 
	1 . Select the new channel and click <b><u>U</u>se Channel</b>. You will see a tip containing a confirmation message that Channel 1 is now active.<br />

	Now try copying some data to Clipboard an you will see the confirmation tip <i>"Transferred to Clipjump"</i> to be preceeded by a <i>{1}</i> which will mean the item is 
	now captured to Clipjump Channel 1. <br />
	Now press Ctrl+V to enter <strong class=super>[PASTE MODE]</strong> . You will see a <i>{1}</i> also preceeding the Clip number message <i>({1} Clip x of y)</i> . As
	 you have already guessed , this means the Clip is contained in Channel 1 .<br>
	<a href="../images/channelpaste.jpg"><img src="../images/channelpaste.jpg" border="0"></a>
	<br /><br>
	Now as you are using Channel 1, you can open the Channel window and use the next available Channel (Channel 2) . <strong class=mild> You can use as many as channels you 	want </strong> but it is recommended to use few channels to avoid confusing yourself.<br /><br />
	
	<strong class=super>IMPORTANT</Strong><br>
	Note that Clipjump uses Channel 0 as the default and the main channel and should be used for general purposes . Channel 0 is the only channel for which the <i><b>
	Minimum Number of Active Clips</b></i> setting is valid, all other channel have no minimum and thus store unlimited clips. <br>
	The setting <i>Retain Clipboard data upon Application restart</i> is invalid on channels other than 0 and so channels 1+ store clips until they are deleted by the user.
	<br /><br /><br />

	<h2><a name=uses>Ideas on using</a></h2>
	One of the best uses of Clipjump Channels is using it as a top 10 repository for storing frequently used items. As said above , you can copy and thus save your 			signatures , blog links and avatar images in a channel and quickle access them when needed.
	<br><br /><br />

	<h2><a name=tips>A Tip for better productivity</a></h2>
	After using the Channel Selector window , you may feel swapping between channels can be slow at times.<br>
	To overcome this , you can enable <code>Use Minimal GUI</code> in the <i>Channels</i> section of the Settings editor. The Minimal GUI will have no buttons, you will 
	have to use Up-Down Arrow keys to change channels and <b>Enter</b> to confirm changes.
