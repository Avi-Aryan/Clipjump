<h4><a name=bu>Basic Usage</a></h4><br>
<ul>
<li>After Downloading Clipjump, unzip it and run Clipjump.exe .<br>
It's a portable application so no installation is needed.<br>
<li>When you run the exe, Clipjump's icon will be seen in SystemTray.<br><br>
<a href="../images/trayicon.jpg"><img src="../images/trayicon.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>Try copying either by Ctrl+C or by Right Click -> Copy or Shift+PrintScreen
<li>You will notice a Tip, <b>[Transferred to Clipjump]</b>  when you copy something.This will mean that the copy has been succeeded.<br><br>
<a href="../images/copy.jpg"><img src="../images/copy.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>Now, press <b>Ctrl+V</b>(paste action), you will see a tip containing the file or text to be copied.<strong class="super">[This is Paste Mode]</strong>.
If an Image has been copied, a Window showing your image will pop-up.<br>
You will have to release Ctrl to perform actions. <i>(You will know later)</i><br>
Here, Release Ctrl to paste.<br> <br>
<a href="../images/pasting.jpg"><img src="../images/pasting.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>To move through Multiple Clipboards, press V again while holding Ctrl. [while in Paste Mode]<br>
Release Ctrl to Paste.Tap C while holding Ctrl to move backwards.
<li>To Cancel Copy, press X while in Paste mode <b>[Ctrl Pressed]</b>.<br>
The tip should change to a Cancel Message. This is <strong class="mild">[Cancel Mode]</strong><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.<br>
<a href="../images/cancel.jpg"><img src="../images/cancel.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<li>To Delete Current Clipboard, press X twice in Paste Mode or once in Cancel Mode.
The tip should now change to a Delete Message. This is <b>[Delete Mode]</b><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.<br><br>
<a href="../images/delete.jpg"><img src="../images/delete.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
To Delete all Clips, press X thrice in Paste Mode OR twice in Cancel Mode OR once in Delete Mode.
The tip should change to a Delete All message.This is <b>[Delete All Mode]</b> <br>
<a href="../images/deleteall.jpg"><img src="../images/deleteall.jpg" border="0"></a><br>
Release Ctrl to confirm.
</ul><br>
<h3>Notes</H3><ul>
<li>As you can see, Releasing Ctrl is the basis of performing actions in Clipjump.
<li>Also, note that Cancel Mode,Delete Mode and Delete All Mode are inter-related.
<strong class="mild">The program cycles through these modes when you press X while holding Ctrl.</strong><br>
<b>So, pressing X while holding Ctrl in Delete All Mode will switch back to Cancel Mode.</b>
</ul><br>
<hr><br>

<h2><a name=au>Advanced Usage</a></h2>
<a name="fixate">
<h3><a name=fx>The Fixate Option</a></h3>
The Fixate option is meant to hold a current Clipboard at a fixed position while
positions of all other Clipboards change.<br>Thus, if a Clipboard is fixed at [Clip 1], it
will stay there at Clip 1 even after numerous Copies and Cuts.<br>
This can be useful if you want a Clipboard entry to be easily accessible every time you
go in Paste Mode using Ctrl+V. <br>
<strong class="super">Please note</strong> that Clipjump remembers last pasted clip's position. So, if you have just pasted [Clip 5], Clipjump will
<b>start from [Clip 5]</b> the next time you press Ctrl and then V [Paste Mode].<br>
A workaround to go to [Clip 1] quickly can be going into [Cancel Mode] after pressing Ctrl+V and canceling and then again pressing Ctrl+V.
Clipjump will now start from [Clip 1]<br><br>
<strong class="super">Using Fixate</strong><br>
Pressing SPACE while in [Paste Mode] toggles the Fixed status of a Clip.<br>
If you reach the clip of your choice and want to fix it, press SPACE and you
will notice a "[FIXED]" written after <b>(Clip x of y)</b>.<br>
This means the Clip is Fixed there. As said above , <strong class="mild">pressing SPACE again
on the fixed clip will remove the FIX from it and the "[FIXED]" from the tip will disappear.</strong>
<br><br>
<a href="../images/fixate.jpg"><img src="../images/fixate.jpg" border="0"></a><br><br>
<strong class="super">Note that the DeleteAll option will delete FIXED Clips too.</strong><br><hr><br>
<h3><a name=path>Copying Paths to Clipjump</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+C will copy path(s) of selected files in Windows
Explorer.<br>
<a href="../images/path.jpg"><img src="../images/path.jpg" border="0"></a>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+X will copy path of current opened folder in Windows
Explorer.</ul>
</a><hr><br><br>

<h3><a name=fdata>Copying File content to Clipjump</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pressing the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+F will copy selected file content to Clipjump
</ul>
<br><br>

<h3><a name=ot>One Time Stop</a></h3>
Many a times you have applications that use Clipboard's common transfer to extract data from various locations.
These apps can be a headache when used with as consistent a tool as Clipjump. <br>
The <b>One Time Stop</b> feature just solves this problem. Available with the configurable shortcut Alt+S, you can call it once to make Clipjump 
automatically ignore the last data and linked content that is transferred to System Clipboard and so Clipjump. 
<br><br>
<strong class=super>WARNING</strong> - <b>One Time Stop</b> is deactivated when Paste Mode is accessed in the <i>ignore</i> period.
<br><br><br>

<a name="winclip">
<h3>Selective Windows Clipboard</h3></a><br>
Many a times there are situations where <b>you are not allowed to paste using the old shortcut Ctrl+V</b> (like in Command Prompt).<br>
There the Selective Windows Clipboard Option comes handy.<br><br>
<strong class="super">Using</strong><br>
Cycle through the clipboards by Ctrl+V or C .When you reach the clip of your choice,
<b>press S</b> while holding Ctrl.<br>
You will see a Confirmation <b>(System Clipboard has Clip x)</b> in form of tip.
That's it.<br>
Now, the Right-Click > Paste Or any other option to Paste <i>other than the old Ctrl + V</i>
will paste the Clip you had choose like it is  currently stored in System Clipboard.<br><hr><br>


<a name=nof>
<h3>No-Formatting Mode</h3>
No formatting mode truncates formatting from Clipjump clips when they are pasted.<br>
To access this mode, use the "Z" key as the toggle when in <strong class=super>[PASTE MODE]</strong><br>
Press "Z" once while in [PASTE MODE] and you will see a <strong class="super">[NO-FORMATTING]</strong> in the Tip.<br>
This will mean all the clipboard data pasted from now onwards will have Formatting truncated.<br>
To disable this mode, press "Z" again while in [PASTE MODE] and the [NO-FORMATTING] text will dissappear.<br><br>
