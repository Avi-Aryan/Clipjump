  Supports preview of Clipboard stored images such as Printscreen captures.
  **Data-Types are meaningless for Clipjump.**It just stores everything.
2.  Control Clipboards only by using Ctrl+x,Ctrl+c and Ctrl+v.
  Not Mandatory to perform Copy and Cut operations using Ctrl+C and Ctrl+X. Even an application's Copy and Cut will be transferred to Clipjump.
